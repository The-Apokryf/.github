putting aside conventions to use distance from oneself instead of criticism to avoid using

Reaching out to catch progress of that mission, even into deepest void of darkness will be 
not even thrilling if it's for cause. Scope that hits us in process of experiencing true scale 
of complexiti of universe's reality can make change in us.

#### Enjoy the darkness

The best way of code is to play with it like futuristic toy or set of creons. If you don't fill

role and become part of something greater.
